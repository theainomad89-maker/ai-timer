# Event Transition Fix - Live Activity Widget

## Problem Identified
The live activity widget was showing the event timer stuck at "0:00" after the first event completed, while the total timer continued working correctly. This happened because:

1. **Timer Interval Issue**: The widget was using `timerInterval: eventStart...eventEnd` but when events transitioned, the interval could become invalid
2. **Update Timing**: There might be a slight delay between when an event ends and when the live activity updates with the new event information

## Root Cause
The widget's `eventCountdownText` function was using:
```swift
Text(timerInterval: context.state.eventStart...context.state.eventEnd, countsDown: true)
```

When an event ended and a new event started, the `eventStart` and `eventEnd` times were updated, but if there was any timing issue or if the interval became invalid, the widget would show "0:00".

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Improved Timer Logic in Widget**
Updated both `eventCountdownText` and `totalCountdownText` functions to:
- Calculate remaining time dynamically using current time
- Use a fallback mechanism if the timer interval is invalid
- Always use current time as the start point for countdown

**New Logic:**
```swift
let now = Date()
let timeRemaining = context.state.eventEnd.timeIntervalSince(now)

if timeRemaining > 0 {
    Text(timerInterval: now...context.state.eventEnd, countsDown: true)
        .monospacedDigit()
} else {
    Text(formatTime(0))
        .monospacedDigit()
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**
Added detailed logging in both JavaScript and iOS native code to track:
- Event transition updates
- Live activity update success/failure
- Timer interval calculations

### 3. **Files Modified**
- `ios/PulseLiveActivity/PulseLiveActivityLiveActivity.swift` - Updated timer display logic
- `ios/Pulse/LiveActivityManager.swift` - Added detailed logging
- `components/TimerRunner.tsx` - Enhanced JavaScript logging

## How This Fixes the Issue

1. **Dynamic Timer Calculation**: Instead of relying on potentially stale timer intervals, the widget now calculates remaining time dynamically
2. **Robust Fallback**: If the timer interval is invalid, it gracefully falls back to showing "0:00"
3. **Current Time Reference**: Always uses the current time as the reference point, ensuring the countdown works correctly
4. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced logging helps identify any remaining issues

## Expected Result
- Event timer should now properly transition from one event to the next
- No more "0:00" stuck display after event transitions
- Both lock screen widget and dynamic island should update correctly
- Total timer continues to work as before

## Testing
After rebuilding the app, test:
1. Start a workout with multiple events
2. Let the first event complete
3. Verify the event timer resets and starts counting for the next event
4. Check both lock screen and dynamic island display
5. Verify pause/resume functionality still works
