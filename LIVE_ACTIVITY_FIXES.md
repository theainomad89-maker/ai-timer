# Live Activity Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Overly Complex Timer Management**
- **Problem**: The original implementation tried to manage multiple timestamps (eventStart, eventEnd, totalStart, totalEnd, eventRemaining, totalRemaining) which caused synchronization issues.
- **Solution**: Simplified to use just two key timestamps: `currentEventStartTime` and `workoutStartTime`, with durations calculated from these.

### 2. **Incorrect Live Activity Updates**
- **Problem**: The app was trying to update live activities with complex remaining time calculations that didn't sync properly with the widget's timer intervals.
- **Solution**: Updated the live activity with proper start times and durations, letting iOS handle the countdown display automatically.

### 3. **Missing Event Synchronization**
- **Problem**: When events changed in the workout, the live activity wasn't properly updated with new event information.
- **Solution**: Simplified the update process to only pass essential information: current event label, next event label, event duration, and start times.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **New Live Activity Service** (`lib/liveActivityNew.ts`)
- Simplified interface with cleaner data structure
- Removed complex timestamp calculations
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. **Updated iOS Native Module** (`ios/Pulse/LiveActivityManager.swift`)
- Simplified method signatures
- Cleaner timestamp handling
- Better error logging

### 3. **Updated TimerRunner Component** (`components/TimerRunner.tsx`)
- Simplified live activity update logic
- Removed complex remaining time calculations
- Better event transition handling

### 4. **Added Event Listeners** (`hooks/useLiveActivityEvents.ts`)
- Hook to handle live activity events from widget
- App state synchronization
- Placeholder for notification handling

## How It Works Now

1. **Starting a Workout**: The app starts a live activity with the current event's start time and duration
2. **Event Transitions**: When an event ends, the app updates the live activity with the new event's information
3. **Pause/Resume**: The app updates the live activity's paused state
4. **Widget Display**: iOS automatically handles the countdown display using the timer intervals
5. **Synchronization**: The widget and app stay in sync through proper timestamp management

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Build and Test**
```bash
cd ai-timer-mobile
npx expo run:ios
```

### 2. **Test Scenarios**
1. **Start a workout** - Live activity should appear on lock screen and dynamic island
2. **Let first event complete** - Live activity should update to show next event
3. **Pause the workout** - Live activity should show paused state
4. **Resume the workout** - Live activity should resume counting
5. **Complete the workout** - Live activity should end

### 3. **What to Look For**
- Live activity appears on lock screen and dynamic island
- Timer counts down properly in both locations
- Event transitions update the live activity correctly
- Pause/resume works from both app and widget
- No more "goes to 0" issue after first event

## Next Steps

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console logs for any error messages
2. Verify that Live Activities are enabled in iOS Settings
3. Make sure you're testing on a physical device (Live Activities don't work in simulator)
4. Check that the app has proper Live Activity entitlements

The implementation now follows the same pattern as the working reference project, which should resolve the synchronization issues you were experiencing.
