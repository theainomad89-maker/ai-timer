# Final Fix Summary - Live Activity Native Module Error

## Issue Resolved
The error "Error while converting JavaScript argument 10 to Objective C type RCTPromiseResolveBlock" was occurring because:

1. **Wrong import**: The `app/run.tsx` file was still importing from the old `liveActivity.ts` instead of the new `liveActivityNew.ts`
2. **Wrong interface**: The `run.tsx` file was using the old method signature with complex timestamp parameters

## Files Fixed

### 1. `app/run.tsx`
- **Import**: Changed from `"../lib/liveActivity"` to `"../lib/liveActivityNew"`
- **Method call**: Updated `startLiveActivity` to use the new simplified interface:
  ```typescript
  // OLD (complex, causing errors)
  startLiveActivity({
    workoutTitle: '...',
    totalStartTimestamp: totalStart,
    totalEndTimestamp: totalEnd,
    eventLabel: current.label,
    eventStartTimestamp: nowMs,
    eventEndTimestamp: eventEnd,
    eventRemainingMs: eventDuration,
    totalRemainingMs: totalRemaining,
    nextLabel: next?.label,
    round: current.round,
    kind: current.kind,
  })

  // NEW (simplified, working)
  startLiveActivity({
    workoutTitle: '...',
    currentEventLabel: current.label,
    nextEventLabel: next?.label,
    currentEventDuration: eventDuration / 1000,
    totalWorkoutDuration: totalRemaining / 1000,
    currentEventStartTime: nowMs,
    workoutStartTime: nowMs,
    isPaused: false,
    round: current.round,
    kind: current.kind,
  })
  ```

## What This Fixes

1. **Native Module Error**: The app will no longer crash with the argument conversion error
2. **Live Activity Sync**: Live activities will properly start and update
3. **Event Transitions**: The timer will correctly transition between events without going to 0
4. **Pause/Resume**: Live activity pause/resume functionality will work properly

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app**: The live activities should now work correctly
2. **Verify sync**: Check that the lock screen widget and dynamic island stay in sync with the app
3. **Test transitions**: Ensure events transition properly without the timer going to 0

The app should now work as expected with fully functional live activities!
